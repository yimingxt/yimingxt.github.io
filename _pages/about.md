<p>
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Kentucky. 
  
From 09/2023 to 08/2024, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo, mentored by <a href="https://aukosh.github.io/">Aukosh Jagannath</a>. Prior to that, I worked as a Quantitative Analytics Specialist at Wells Fargo Bank for a year. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Utah in 05/2022 under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~alberts/">Tom Alberts</a> and <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/~akil/index.html">Akil Narayan</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research interest is in mathematics of data. Specifically, I work on randomized algorithms, network data analysis, and multifidelity methods. As a problem-driven researcher, I enjoy learning new ideas and open to potential collaboration.

Note: I no longer have access to the old webpage located at <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~yxu/">[utah]</a>. Consequently, I won't be able to make any further updates to it.
