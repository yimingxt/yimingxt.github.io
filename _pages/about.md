<p>
I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo. I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Utah in 2022 and subsequently spent a year at Wells Fargo. Beginning in Fall 2024, I will join the University of Kentucky as an assistant professor.

<p>
My research interest is in mathematics of data. Specifically, I work on randomized algorithms, network data analysis, and multifidelity methods. As a problem-driven researcher, I enjoy learning new ideas from all walks of life and finding connections between them.

Note: I no longer have access to the old webpage located at <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~yxu/">[utah]</a>. Consequently, I won't be able to make any further updates to it.
