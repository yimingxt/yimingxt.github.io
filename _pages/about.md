<p>
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Kentucky. 
</p>

<p>
From 09/2023 to 08/2024, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo, mentored by <a href="https://aukosh.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none;">Aukosh Jagannath</a>. Prior to that, I worked as a Quantitative Analytics Specialist at Wells Fargo Bank. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Utah in 2022 under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~alberts/" style="text-decoration: none;">Tom Alberts</a> and <a href="https://www.sci.utah.edu/~akil/index.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Akil Narayan</a>.
</p>

<p>
My research interests lie in the mathematics of data. Specifically, I work on randomized algorithms, network data analysis, and multifidelity methods. As a problem-driven researcher, I enjoy learning new ideas and am open to potential collaborations.
