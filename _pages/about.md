<p>
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Kentucky. 
</p>

<p>
I did my postdoc at the University of Waterloo (2023-2024) with <a href="https://aukosh.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none;">Aukosh Jagannath</a>. Prior to that, I worked as a Quantitative Analyst at Wells Fargo Bank (2022-2023). I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Utah (2017-2022). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lifeinutah206/videos" style="text-decoration: none;">Utah</a> is a beautiful place that holds many sweet memories from my early adulthood, with amazing natural scenery, abundant outdoor activities, and more.
</p>

<p>
My research interests lie in the mathematics of data. Specifically, I work on random sampling and approximation, statistical learning, and multifidelity methods. As a problem-driven researcher, I enjoy learning new ideas and am open to potential collaborations.
